# Hi, I'm Sam 👋  
<!--
👨‍💻 About Me  
I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at the University of Maryland, College Park, with a minor in **Spanish Literature, Linguistics, and Culture**. Expected to graduate in **May 2025**.
##
## 🚀 Projects & Experience  
### 🔍 **Analyzing Global Happiness with Machine Learning**  
In this project, I used **Python** to explore how factors such as GDP, education, and social support contribute to happiness worldwide. I performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** with tools like **seaborn** and **matplotlib**, and applied **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest models** to predict happiness scores. This project was a great experience blending **data science** with machine learning to generate meaningful insights.

### 🏕 **Summer Camp App**  
Built a **full-stack web application** using **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, streamlining the process of handling user submissions for a summer camp. I implemented RESTful API endpoints to connect the front-end with the backend, managing submissions efficiently. This project deepened my expertise in **JavaScript frameworks** and database management while giving me hands-on experience with **MongoDB**.

### 🌞 **Solar Flare Analysis**  
Leveraging **Python**, I scraped data from **NASA** and **SpaceWeatherLive** to analyze patterns in solar flares. I used **pandas** and **numpy** to clean and manipulate the data, categorized flares, and identified key trends. This project strengthened my ability to work with **data pipelines** and perform **scientific analysis**.

### 💼 **Data Analyst Intern at PrimePay**  
During my time at PrimePay, I designed **ETL data pipelines** using **Microsoft Fabric** and **Apache Spark Notebooks** to integrate and process financial data. I applied **machine learning models** like **Linear Regression** and **K-Means Clustering** to derive insights from customer financial data. Working with a **Scrum team**, I collaborated on a migration project involving **Microsoft Azure** technologies and developed financial reports in **PowerBI**.  

## 🛠 Technical Skills  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, OCaml, Racket, SQL, Rust, HTML/CSS, MATLAB  
- **Technologies**: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, Microsoft Fabric, Apache Spark, PowerBI  
- **Development Practices**: Git, DevOps, Scrum, Data Pipelines  

## 📚 Coursework  
I’ve taken key Computer Science courses such as:  
- **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, and **Object-Oriented Programming**  
- **Web Development**, **Data Science**, and **Compilers**  
- **Network Security**, **Probability & Statistics**, and **Linear Algebra**  

These courses have given me a solid foundation in solving complex problems, designing efficient algorithms, and developing applications.

## 🌍 A Little More About Me  
When I’m not coding, I enjoy **painting and drawing**, a passion I've enjoyed for over a decade. I also love **learning languages** and immersing myself in different cultures, which is reflected in my minor in Spanish.
